# HeadsUpPoker
Standard heads up poker game built using java and javaswing (in progress). 
Cards are dealt to each player from a 52 card deck and standard NLHE rules apply. Player will face a bot that will 
be built using simple artificial intelligence logic. Feel free to play whenever you want to gamble without using
real money! :)
